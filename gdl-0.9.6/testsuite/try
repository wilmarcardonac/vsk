# expected arguments (passed by make to this script):
# - argument $1 should point to $(top_srcdir) 
# - argument $2 should be the name of the .pro file to be executed (with leading /)
# both conditions are ensured in Makefile.am

# expected contents/behaviour of the GDL file:
# - the script to be tried shoud exit with a non-zero status if failed
#   (if the scripts exits with status 77, automake will ignore the failure)
# - the file should contain a procedure named in accordance with the
#   file name, e.g. test_wavelet in test_wavelet.pro
# - the procedure should not need any arguments/keywords

# a quick & dirty way of making the "checks" script work
#test "x$2" = "x./checks" && exit
test "x$3" = "x./checks" && exit
