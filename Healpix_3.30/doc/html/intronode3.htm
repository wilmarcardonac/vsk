<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Discretisation of Functions on the Sphere for 
High Resolution Applications:
a Motivation for <b>HEALPix</b> </A>
</H1>

<P>
Numerical analysis of functions on the sphere involves 
(1) a class of mathematical operations, whose objects are 
(2) discretised maps, i.e. quantizations of arbitrary functions 
according to a
chosen tessellation (exhaustive partition of the sphere into 
finite area elements). Hereafter we mostly specialise our discussion 
to CMB related applications of
<b>HEALPix</b>, 
but all our statements hold true generally for any relevant 
deterministic and random functions on the sphere.

<P>
Considering point (1):
Standard operations of numerical analysis which one might wish to
execute on the sphere include
convolutions with local and global kernels, 
Fourier analysis with spherical harmonics
and power spectrum estimation,
wavelet decomposition, nearest-neighbour searches, topological
analysis, including searches for extrema or zero-crossings, 
computing Minkowski functionals,
extraction of patches and
finite differencing for solving partial
differential equations.
Some of these operations become prohibitively slow  
if the sampling of functions on the sphere, and the related structure of 
the discrete data set, are not designed carefully. 

<P>
Regarding point (2): 
Typically, a whole sky map rendered by a CMB experiment contains 
(<I>i</I>) signals coming from the sky,
which are by design strongly band-width limited (in the sense of 
spatial Fourier
decomposition) by the instrument's angular response 
function, and 
(<I>ii</I>) a projection into the elements of a discrete map, or pixels,
of the observing instrument's noise; this pixel noise should be random,
and white, at least near the discretisation scale, with a band-width 
significantly exceeding that of all the signals. 

<P>
With these considerations in mind we propose the following list of 
desiderata 
for the mathematical structure of discretised full sky maps:

<P>
<B>1. Hierarchical structure of the data base</B>. This is recognised as 
essential for very large data bases, and was  postulated 
in construction
of the Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube 
(or quad-sphere, see 
<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/skymap_info.html"><TT>http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/skymap_info.html</TT></A>), 
which was used for the
<I>COBE</I> data. An  argument in favour of this 
proposition
states that the data elements  
which are nearby in a multi-dimensional configuration space 
(here, on the surface of 
a sphere), are also nearby in the tree structure of the data base, hence
the near-neighbour searches are conducted optimally in the data storage medium
or computer RAM.
This property, especially when implemented with a small number of base
resolution elements, 
facilitates various topological methods of analysis, 
and allows easy construction
of wavelet transforms on quadrilateral (and also triangular) grids. 
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:quadtree">1</A> shows how a hierarchical partition with 
quadrilateral structure naturally allows for a binary vector indexing
of the data base.

<P>

<CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG>
Quadrilateral tree pixel numbering. 
The coarsely pixelated coordinate patch on
the left consists 
of four pixels. Two bits suffice to label the pixels. 
To increase the resolution, every 
pixel splits into 
4 daughter pixels shown on the right. These daughters inherit the pixel
index of their 
parent (boxed) and acquire 
two new bits to give the new pixel index. 
Several such curvilinearly mapped coordinate patches 
(12 in the case of <b>HEALPix</b>, and 6 in the case of the <I>COBE</I> quad-sphere) 
are joined at the boundaries to cover
the sphere. All pixels indices carry a prefix (here omitted for clarity) 
which identifies which base-resolution pixel they belong to.</CAPTION>

<P>
<B>2. Equal areas of discrete elements of partition</B>. This is advantageous 
because (<I>i</I>)
white noise generated by the  signal receiver 
gets integrated exactly into
white noise in the pixel space, and 
(<I>ii</I>) sky signals are sampled without regional dependence, except for 
the dependence on pixel shapes, which is unavoidable with tessellations of the 
sphere. 
Hence, as much as possible given the experimental details, the pixel
size should be made sufficiently small compared to the 
instrument's resolution to avoid any excessive, and pixel shape dependent, 
signal smoothing.

<P>
<B>3. Iso-Latitude distribution of discrete area elements on a sphere</B>.  
This property
is critical for computational speed of all operations involving evaluation of 
spherical
harmonics. Since the associated Legendre polynomial components of
spherical harmonics are evaluated via
slow recursions, and 
can not be simply handled in an analogous way to the trigonometric Fast Fourier Transform, 
any deviations in the sampling grid from an iso-latitude
distribution result in a prohibitive loss of computational performance
with the growing number of sampling points, or increasing map resolution.
It is precisely this property that the <I>COBE</I> quad-sphere is lacking,
and this renders it impractical for applications to high resolution data.

<P>
A number of tessellations 
have been  used for discretisation and analysis 
of functions on the sphere (for example, see  
<A
 HREF="intronode9.htm#drhea">Driscoll &amp; Healy  (1994)</A>,
<A
 HREF="intronode9.htm#munavi">Muciaccia, Natoli &amp; Vittorio  (1998)</A>, <A
 HREF="intronode9.htm#glesp">Doroshkevich et al.  (2005)</A> -- rectangular grids,

and <A
 HREF="intronode9.htm#szalay">Szalay &amp; Brunner  (1998)</A>  -- a triangular grid), but none 
satisfies simultaneously all three stated requirements. 

<P>
All three requirements formulated above are satisfied by construction with the
Hierarchical Equal Area, iso-Latitude Pixelation (<b>HEALPix</b>) 
of the sphere, which is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:HEALPIX">2</A>.
A more detailed description of
<b>HEALPix</b>, its motivations, and applications can be found in <A
