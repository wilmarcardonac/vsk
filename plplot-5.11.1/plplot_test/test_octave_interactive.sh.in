# -dev wxwidgets will work on one at a time, but segfaults
# for multiple examples.

# -dev xcairo very slow on all of these (the well-known interactive
# slowness issue with that device).
# 17 - the selection rectangle is not drawn because xcairo does not support xor mode.

# The following comments are for -dev qtwidget.
# 14 - looks pretty to start but then segfaults on some systems (octave 3.0?);
#    - with octave 3.2 the animation does not work correctly (as with xwin / tk )
# 17 - the selection rectangle is not drawn because qtwidget does not support xor mode.

# -dev wxwidgets had similar issues except possibly for examples 18
# and 19 which seemed fine, but there is no way to tell for sure with
# second wxwidgets example (no matter what) always segfaulting.

# -dev xwin and -dev tk worked for all examples and Octave-3.0.  For
# Octave-3.2 the animation for p14 does not work correctly with these devices.

# Remove 7, 16, 20 until plshade1 fix is done.
# Remove 17 until an additional fix is done.
# Remove combined example 21.
