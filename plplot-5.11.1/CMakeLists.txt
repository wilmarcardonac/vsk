# Recommended way to do user overrides of C-related variables, is given at
# http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake/2006-July/010334.html.
# See also, CMakeCInformation.cmake.  There are also C++, and Fortran-specific
# overrides that can be done.  However, I prefer putting overrides in just
# one file so I use the overall variable CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
# instead.

# MAINTENANCE
# We prefer to support only recent CMake versions and latest CMake
# policies to keep our build system as simple and as bug free as
# possible.  However, as a special concession for our modern (not
# enterprise or LTS) Linux distro users and our Cygwin users we allow
# them to use the system version of CMake which at this time (2015-05)
# is typically 3.0.2 or later.  By coincidence there is a CMake bug
# for 3.0 (a permissions issue for file(GENERATE...), see
# cmake/modules/plplot_functions.cmake for details) that has a
# workaround that only works on Cygwin and Linux so all other
# platforms than Cygwin and Linux _must_ use CMake 3.2.

# Adapted method suggested by Brad King for using
# different minimum versions for different platforms.
