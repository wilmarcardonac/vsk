The purpose of this complete project is to provide a simple Ada test case
consisting of an Ada executable calling a single routine in an Ada library
which prints out the classic "hello, world" phrase.  This complete project
includes a CMake-based build system and files for Ada language support
within CMake which will eventually become part of CMake itself.

To run the test

(1) create an empty build directory and cd to it.
mkdir build_dir

(2) configure project with cmake 

  option a (built library is static).

cmake path/to/this/source/directory

  option b (built library is shared).

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON path/to/this/source/directory

(3) build library and executable that links to it
make

(4) run test that should generate "hello, world" phrase.

src_executable/hello

In sum, this project provides a simple demonstration of how to use the CMake
Ada language support with Ada libraries that are either static or shared. At
the same time, this project tests the quality of CMake Ada support for
various user's platforms.  If any user is having trouble with CMake Ada
language support, this is the simple test case they should run first.
