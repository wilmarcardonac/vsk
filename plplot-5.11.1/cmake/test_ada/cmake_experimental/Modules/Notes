I have been creating the 2.6 versions of the Ada language support files by
looking at what is done for C, C++, and Fortran.  As a first step
gratuitous inconsistencies between those flavours of support files were
eliminated.

I. CMakeDetermine(LANG)Compiler.cmake.

Changes:

a. Removed all trailing white space for C, CXX, and Fortran versions.

b. C version:

"SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_INIT NOTFOUND)" removed.  This change was introduced
at 1.12, but I believe it was an oversight then (copied in error from the
CXX version), and I cannot see any
purpose now since this variable does not occur anywhere else in the file.
N.B. However, I could be missing something so please review.

The only other C change was to make comments more consistent with CXX and
Fortran versions.

c. CXX version:

Changed CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_INIT logic to be consistent with the equivalent C
and Fortran logic.  The principle change is to remove
"SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_INIT NOTFOUND)" at the start of everything and
removing the output of CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_INIT from one of the FATAL ERROR
messages.

N.B. the above change should be reviewed, and if the C++ style of
CMAKE_(LANG)_COMPILER_INIT logic is preferred, then the C and Fortran versions
should be changed instead.

The only other CXX change was to make comments more consistent with C and
Fortran versions.

d. Fortran version:

Instead of using empty IF(...) branch followed by ELSE(...) branch which
actually does something, used IF(NOT ...) logic form instead to be consistent
with C and CXX versions.

The only other Fortran change was to make comments more consistent with C and
CXX versions.

Useful comparison of C, Fortran, and CXX versions with most expected
differences removed.  The above changes substantially reduce the size of the
remaining differences.

e. Ada version:

Adopt the same style as the (changed) Fortran version.  (The C and CXX
versions are not as suitable as templates because they include a lot of
cross-compile stuff.)  A large part of the Fortran version is ignored
that has to do with choosing the compiler and checking its identity since
only gnatmake is supported in the Ada case.

II. CMake(LANG)Compiler.cmake.in

Useful comparison of C, Fortran, and CXX versions with most expected
differences removed.  The above changes substantially reduce the size of the
remaining differences.
