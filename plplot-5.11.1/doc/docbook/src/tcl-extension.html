      Tcl does many things well, but handling collections of numbers is not
      one of them.   You could make lists, but for data sets of sizes
      relevant to scientific graphics which is the primary domain of
      applicability for PLplot, the extraction time is excessive and
      burdensome.  You could use Tcl arrays, but the storage overhead is
      astronomical and the lookup time, while better than list manipulation,
      is still prohibitive.  
    </p><p>
      To cope with this, a Tcl Matrix extension was created for the
      purpose of making it feasible to work with large collections of
      numbers in Tcl, in a way which is storage efficient, reasonably 
      efficient for accesses from Tcl, and reasonably compatible with
      practices used in compiled code.

	Much like the Tk widget creation commands, the Tcl <code class="literal">matrix</code>
	command considers its first argument to be the name of a new command
	to be created, and the rest of the arguments to be modifiers.  After
	the name, the next argument can be <code class="literal">float</code> or
	<code class="literal">int</code> or
	contractions thereof.  Next follow a variable number of size arguments
	which determine the size of the matrix in each of its dimensions.  For
	example: 
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	matrix x f 100
	matrix y i 64 64
      </pre><p>
	constructs two matrices.  <code class="literal">x</code> is a float matrix, with one
	dimension and 100 elements.  <code class="literal">y</code> is an integer matrix, and has 2
	dimensions each of size 64.
      </p><p>
	Additionally, an initializer may be specified, with a syntax familiar
	from C.  For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	matrix x f 4 = { 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 }
      </pre><p>
	A Tcl matrix is a command, and as longtime Tcl users know, Tcl
	commands are globally accessible.  The PLplot Tcl Matrix extension
	attempts to lessen the impact of this by registering a variable in the
	local scope, and tracing it for insets, and deleting the actual
	matrix command when the variable goes out of scope.  In this way, a
	Tcl matrix appears to work sort of like a variable.  It is, however,
	just an illusion, so you have to keep this in mind.  In particular,
	you may want the matrix to outlive the scope in which it was created.
	For example, you may want to create a matrix, load it with data, and
	then pass it off to a Tk megawidget for display in a spreadsheet like
	form.  The proc which launches the Tk megawidget will complete, but
	the megawidget, and the associated Tcl matrix are supposed to hang
	around until they are explicitly destroyed.  To achieve this effect,
	create the Tcl matrix with the <code class="literal">-persist</code> flag.  If present
	(can be anywhere on the line), the matrix is not automatically deleted
	when the scope of the current proc (method) ends.  Instead, you must
	explicitly clean up by using either the 'delete' matrix command or renaming
	the matrix command name to {}.  Now works correctly from within [incr Tcl].
      </p><p>
	As mentioned above, the result of creating a matrix is that a new
	command of the given name is added to the interpreter.  You can then
	evaluate the command, providing indices as arguments, to extract the
	data.  For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	pltcl&gt; matrix x f = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5}
	insufficient dimensions given for Matrix operator "x"
	pltcl&gt; matrix x f 4 = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5}
	pltcl&gt; x 0
	1.500000
	pltcl&gt; x 1
	2.500000
	pltcl&gt; x 3
	4.500000
	pltcl&gt; x *
	1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000
	pltcl&gt; puts "x\[1\]=[x 1]"
	x[1]=2.500000
	pltcl&gt; puts "x\[*\] = :[x *]:"
	x[*] = :1.500000 2.500000 3.500000 4.500000:
	pltcl&gt; foreach v [x *] { puts $v }
	1.500000
	2.500000
	3.500000
	4.500000
	pltcl&gt; for {set i 0} {$i &lt; 4} {incr i} {
	if {[x $i] &lt; 3} {puts [x $i]} }
	1.500000
	2.500000
      </pre><p>
	Note from the above that the output of evaluating a matrix indexing
	operation is suitable for use in condition processing, list
	processing, etc.
      </p><p>
	You can assign to matrix locations in a similar way:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	pltcl&gt; x 2 = 7
	pltcl&gt; puts ":[x *]:"
	:1.500000 2.500000 7.000000 4.500000:
	pltcl&gt; x * = 3
	pltcl&gt; puts ":[x *]:"
      </pre><p>
	Note that the * provides a means of obtaining an index range, and that
	it must be separated from the = by a space.  Future versions of the
	Tcl Matrix extension may allow alternative ways of specifying index
	ranges and may assign the obvious meaning to an expression of the
	form:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	x *= 3
      </pre><p>
	However this has not been implemented yet...
      </p><p>
	In any event, the <code class="literal">matrix</code> command also supports an
	<code class="literal">info</code>
	subcommand which reports the number of elements in each dimension:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	pltcl&gt; x info
	4 
	pltcl&gt; matrix y i 8 10
	pltcl&gt; y info
	8 10 
      </pre></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Tcl Matrices from C"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tcl-using-c"></a>Using Tcl Matrices from C</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Normally you will create a matrix in Tcl, and then want to pass it to
	C in order to have the data filled in, or existing data to be used in
	a computation, etc.  To do this, pass the name of the matrix command
	as an argument to your C Tcl command procedure.  The C code should
	include <code class="filename">tclMatrix.h</code>, which has a definition for the
	<code class="literal">tclMatrix</code> structure.  You fetch a pointer to the
	<code class="literal">tclMatrix</code> structure using the
	<code class="literal">Tcl_GetMatrixPtr</code> function.
      </p><p>
	For example, in Tcl:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	matrix x f 100
	wacky x
      </pre><p>
	and in C:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	int wackyCmd( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp,
	int argc, char *argv[] )
	{
	tclMatrix *w;

	w = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
	...
      </pre><p>
	To learn about what else you can do with the matrix once inside
	compiled code, read <code class="filename">tclMatrix.h</code> to learn the definition of the
	<code class="literal">tclMatrix</code> structure, and see the examples in files like
	<code class="filename">tclAPI.c</code> which show many various uses of the Tcl matrix.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Tcl Matrices from C++"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tcl-using-cplusplus"></a>Using Tcl Matrices from C++</h3></div></div></div><p>
	Using a Tcl matrix from C++ is very much like using it from C, except
	that <code class="filename">tclMatrix.h</code> contains some C++ wrapper classes which are
	somewhat more convenient than using the indexing macros which one has
	to use in C.  For example, here is a tiny snippet from one of the
	authors codes in which Tcl matrices are passed in from Tcl to a C++
	routine which is supposed to fill them in with values from some
	matrices used in the compiled side of the code:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	...
	if (item == "vertex_coords") {
	tclMatrix *matxg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[1] );
	tclMatrix *matyg = Tcl_GetMatrixPtr( interp, argv[2] );

	Mat2&lt;float&gt; xg(ncu, ncv), yg(ncu, ncv);
	cg-&gt;Get_Vertex_Coords( xg, yg );

	TclMatFloat txg( matxg ), tyg( matyg );

	for( i=0; i &lt; ncu; i++ )
	for( j=0; j &lt; ncv; j++ ) {
	txg(i,j) = xg(i,j);
	tyg(i,j) = yg(i,j);
	}
      </pre><p>
	There are other things you can do too, see the definitions of the
	<code class="literal">TclMatFloat</code> and <code class="literal">TclMatInt</code> classes in
	<code class="filename">tclMatrix.h</code>. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Extending the Tcl Matrix facility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tcl-extending"></a>Extending the Tcl Matrix facility</h3></div></div></div><p>
	The Tcl matrix facility provides creation, indexing, and information
	gathering facilities.  However, considering the scientifically
	inclined PLplot user base, it is clear that some users will demand
	more.  Consequently there is a mechanism for augmenting the Tcl matrix
	facility with your own, user defined, extension subcommands.  Consider
	<code class="filename">xtk04.c</code>.  In this extended wish, we want to be able to
	determine the minimum and maximum values stored in a matrix.  Doing
	this in Tcl would involve nested loops, which in Tcl would be
	prohibitively slow.  We could register a Tcl extension command to do
	it, but since the only sensible data for such a command would be a
	Tcl matrix, it seems nice to provide this facility as an actual
	subcommand of the matrix.  However, the PLplot maintainers cannot
	foresee every need, so a mechanism is provided to register subcommands
	for use with matrix objects.
      </p><p>
	The way to register matrix extension subcommands is to call
	<code class="literal">Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn</code>: 
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	typedef int (*tclMatrixXtnsnProc) ( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
	int argc, char *argv[] );

	int Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( char *cmd, tclMatrixXtnsnProc proc );
      </pre><p>
	In other words, make a function for handling the matrix extension
	subcommand, with the same function signature (prototype) as
	<code class="literal">tclMatrixXtnsnProc</code>, and register the subcommand name along with
	the function pointer.  For example, xtk04.c has:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	int mat_max( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
	int argc, char *argv[] )
	{
	float max = pm-&gt;fdata[0];
	int i;
	for( i=1; i &lt; pm-&gt;len; i++ )
	if (pm-&gt;fdata[i] &gt; max)
	max = pm-&gt;fdata[i];

	sprintf( interp-&gt;result, "%f", max );
	return TCL_OK;
	}

	int mat_min( tclMatrix *pm, Tcl_Interp *interp,
	int argc, char *argv[] )
	{
	float min = pm-&gt;fdata[0];
	int i;
	for( i=1; i &lt; pm-&gt;len; i++ )
	if (pm-&gt;fdata[i] &lt; min)
	min = pm-&gt;fdata[i];

	sprintf( interp-&gt;result, "%f", min );
	return TCL_OK;
	}
      </pre><p>
	Then, inside the application initialization function
	(<code class="literal">Tcl_AppInit()</code> to long time Tcl users):
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "max", mat_max );
	Tcl_MatrixInstallXtnsn( "min", mat_min );
      </pre><p>
	Then we can do things like:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	dino 65: xtk04
	% matrix x f 4 = {1, 2, 3, 1.5}
	% x min
	1.000000
	% x max
	3.000000
      </pre><p>
	Your imagination is your only limit for what you can do with this.
	You could add an FFT subcommand, matrix math, BLAS, whatever.
