    (OLD, NEEDS DOCUMENTATION UPDATING)
    The argument types given in this manual (PLFLT and PLINT) are typedefs for
    the actual argument type.  A PLINT is actually a type
    <code class="literal">long</code> and should not be changed.  A PLFLT can be either a
    <code class="literal">float</code> or <code class="literal">double</code>; this choice is made
    when the package is installed and on a Unix system (for example) may result
    in a PLplot library named <code class="filename">libplplot.a</code> in single
    precision and <code class="filename">libplplotd.a</code> in double precision.
  </p><p>
    These and other constants used by PLplot are defined in the main header file
    <code class="filename">plplot.h</code>, which must be included by the user program.  This file also
    contains all of the function prototypes, machine dependent defines, and
    redefinition of the C-language bindings that conflict with the Fortran names
    (more on this later).  <code class="filename">plplot.h</code> obtains its values for PLFLT, PLINT,
    and PLARGS (a macro for conditionally generating prototype argument lists)
    from FLOAT (typedef), INT (typedef), and PROTO (macro), respectively.
    The latter are defined in the file
    <code class="filename">chdr.h</code>.  The user is encouraged to use FLOAT, INT, and PROTO in
    his/her own code, and modify <code class="filename">chdr.h</code> according to taste.  It is not
    actually necessary to declare variables as FLOAT and INT except when they
    are pointers, as automatic conversion to the right type will otherwise occur
    (if using a Standard C compiler; else K&amp;R style automatic promotion will
    occur).  The only code in <code class="filename">plplot.h</code> that directly depends on these
    settings is as follows:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      #include "plplot/chdr.h"

      /* change from chdr.h conventions to plplot ones */

      typedef FLOAT PLFLT;
      typedef INT   PLINT;
      #define PLARGS(a) PROTO(a)
    </pre><p>
  </p><p>
    PLplot is capable of being compiled with Standard C (ANSI) mode on or off.
    This is toggled via the macro PLSTDC, and set automatically if __STDC__
    is defined.  If PLSTDC is defined, all functions are prototyped as allowed
    under Standard C, and arguments passed exactly as specified in the
    prototype.  If PLSTDC is not defined, however, function prototypes are
    turned off and K&amp;R automatic argument promotion will occur, e.g.
    <code class="literal"> float &amp;rarr; double, int &amp;rarr; long</code>.
    There is no middle ground!  A PLplot
    library built with PLSTDC defined will not work (in general) with a program
    built with PLSTDC undefined, and vice versa.  It is possible in principle to
    build a library that will work under both Standard C and K&amp;R compilers
    simultaneously (i.e.  by duplicating the K&amp;R promotion with the Standard C
    prototype), but this seems to violate the spirit of the C standard and can
    be confusing.  Eventually we will drop support for non-standard C compilers
    but for now have adopted this compromise.
  </p><p>
    In summary, PLplot will work using either a Standard or non-standard C
    compiler, provided that you :
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	Include the PLplot main header file <code class="filename">plplot.h</code>.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Make sure all pointer arguments are of the correct type
	(the compiler should warn you if you forget, so don't worry, be happy).
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Do not link a code compiled with PLSTDC defined to a PLplot library
	compiled with PLSTDC undefined, or vice versa.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Use prototypes whenever possible to reduce type errors.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    Note that some Standard C compilers will give warnings when converting a
    constant function argument to whatever is required by the prototype.  These
    warnings can be ignored.
  </p><p>
    The one additional complicating factor concerns the use of stub routines to
    interface with Fortran (see the following section for more explanation).  On
    some systems, the Fortran and C name spaces are set up to clobber each other.
    More reasonable (from our viewpoint) is to agree on a standard map between
    name spaces, such as the appending of an underscore to Fortran routine names
    as is common on many Unix-like systems.  The only case where the shared
    Fortran/C name spaces do any good is when passing a pointer to a like data
    type, which represents only a small fraction of the cases that need to
    be handled (which includes constant values passed on the stack, strings, and
    two-dimensional arrays).
  </p><p>
    There are several ways to deal with this situation, but the least messy from
    a user's perspective is to redefine those PLplot C function names which
    conflict with the Fortran-interface stub routines.  The actual function
    names are the same as those described in this document, but with a
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">c_</span>”</span>
    prepended.  These macro definitions appear in the
    <code class="filename">plplot.h</code> header file
    and are otherwise harmless.  Therefore you can (and should) forget that most
    of the names are being redefined to avoid the conflict and simply adhere to
    the bindings as described in this manual.  Codes written under old versions
    of PLplot (previous to 5.0) will require a recompile, however.

    programs (<code class="filename">x01c.c</code> through <code class="filename">x19c.c</code>)
