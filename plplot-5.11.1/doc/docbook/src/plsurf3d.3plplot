.SH NAME
\fBplsurf3d\fP - Plot shaded 3-d surface plot 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsurf3d\fP(\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIz\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP, \fIopt\fP, \fIclevel\fP, \fInlevel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Plots a three dimensional shaded surface plot within the environment set up by \fBplw3d\fP(3plplot).  The surface is defined by the two-dimensional array \fIz\fP[\fInx\fP][\fIny\fP] , the point \fIz\fP[i][j]  being the value of the function at (\fIx\fP[i], \fIy\fP[j]) .  Note that the points in arrays \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP do not need to be equally spaced, but must be stored in ascending order. For further details see the PLplot documentation. 
.P
Redacted form: \fBplsurf3d(x, y, z, opt, clevel)\fP
.P
This function is not used in any examples. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIx\fP (const PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to set of x coordinate values at which the function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIy\fP (const PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to set of y coordinate values at which the function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIz\fP (const PLFLT * const *, input) 
Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array with set of function values. 
.TP
\fInx\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of \fIx\fP values at which function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIny\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of \fIy\fP values at which function is evaluated. 
.TP
\fIopt\fP (PLINT, input) 
Determines the way in which the surface is represented. To specify more than one option just add the options, e.g. FACETED + SURF_CONT \fIopt\fP=FACETED : Network of lines is drawn connecting points at which function is defined. 
\fIopt\fP=BASE_CONT : A contour plot is drawn at the base XY plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP. 
\fIopt\fP=SURF_CONT : A contour plot is drawn at the surface plane using parameters \fInlevel\fP and \fIclevel\fP. 
\fIopt\fP=DRAW_SIDES : draws a curtain between the base XY plane and the borders of the plotted function. 
\fIopt\fP=MAG_COLOR : the surface is colored according to the value of Z; if MAG_COLOR is not used, then the default the surface is colored according to the intensity of the reflected light in the surface from a light source whose position is set using \fBpllightsource\fP(3plplot). 

.TP
\fIclevel\fP (const PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to the array that defines the contour level spacing. 
.TP
\fInlevel\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of elements in the clevel array.
