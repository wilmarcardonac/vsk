2001-06-26  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* plplotdoc.xml.in: Define PLplot-website entity.
	* intro.xml: Use it.

2001-01-15  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Dependencies for "all" rule come now from
	AC_SUBSTituted variable TARGETS.

2000-12-10  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* plplotdoc-print.dsl.in: The brackets around lineannotations are
	produced now with characters from the "Miscellaneous Technical"
	section of Unicode.  They were before obtained from the "CJK
	Symbols and Punctuation" section which, although having the
	correct glyph, come too far from the east side of the planet.
	Also, instead of using the "&#<decimal>;" notation, use
	"\U-<hexa>". This seems to be a more portable way to insert
	Unicode characters in a SGML document.

2000-12-04  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am (all): Added dependency on man.
	(man): New rule.
	($(MAN_MANIFEST)): New rule for building man pages from the API
	chapter. 
	(.PHONY): Added man.
	(CLEANFILES): Added $(MAN_MANIFEST) and *.$(MANVOL).
	* api.xml: Replace "--" by "&ndash;", as api2man.pl was choking on
	that.

	* Makefile.am (%.xml-info): Added $(SOURCE_FILES) as dependency.
	(%.txml): More robust rule.  If docbook2texixml script fails, the
	target file is not generated.
	(CLEANFILES): Include *-tmp pattern, needed by %.txml rule.
	(%.info): Use AC_SUBST'ed variable MAKEINFO.

2000-11-30  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am ($(BASE).pdf.gz): Implements the recursion trick to
	run pdfjadetex just enough.  Also, the dependency for this is no
	more on the dvi file, but on %.jadetex and jadetex.cfg, as it
	should be.
	(%.pdf.gz): New rule.
	(.PRECIOUS): Added %.pdf.
	(all): Added dependency on info target.

	* plplotdoc-html.dsl.in (element anchor): Only generates the
	<SPAN> output for <anchor>s having id="over-under".

	* pdftex.map: Added more aliases for the Computer Modern fonts.

	* jadetex.cfg: Hyperlinks are colored red now, instead of the
	black default.

2000-11-29  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am (SOURCE_FILES): Removed over-under.eps and
	jadetex.cfg.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added jadetex.cfg and stylesheet.css.
	($(JPEG_MANIFEST), over-under-*): Removed rules.
	(html): Removed dependency on $(JPEG_MANIFEST).
	($(BASE).dvi): Removed dependency on over-under.eps and added
	dependency on jadetex.cfg.
	(CLEANFILES): Removed jpeg related patterns.
	* math.ent: New common entities file, containing the greek and
	math symbols for both printed and HTML outputs.
	* plplotdoc.xml.in: Include math.enc.
	* stylesheet.css: Added file.  This is the Cascade stylesheet file
	for the HTML rendering.
	* over-under.tex: Removed file.
	* jadetex.cfg: Declare Unicode character for producing the
	"S(freq)" overlined and underlined (this was previously obtained
	from over-under.tex). 
	* inline-print.ent, inline-html.ent: Removed greek and math
	entities.  Redifine &over-under; to use <SPAN> and the CSS in
	HTML, and a Unicode character whose translation is provided in
	jadetex.cfg. 
	* plplotdoc-html.dsl.in: Define %stylesheet%.
	Added definition for element `anchor'.
	* plplotdoc-print.dsl.in: The body size is not defined here anymore.
	It will default to 10pt.  The previous 11pt was causing problem
	with the PDF output.

	* pdftex.map: New file.  This is a kludge to make pdfjadetex
	include corretly Computer Modern Type 1 fonts.

2000-11-28  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am ($(BASE).pdf.gz): Forcing compression with gzip.

2000-11-27  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): Added *.out.

	* api.xml: Replace occurrences of "<=" by "&lt;".

	* Info translation works.
	* Makefile.am: Rules for building the info form of documentation
	(using package docbook2X).
	(CLEANFILES): Added info related patterns. 
	(.PRECIOUS): Add patterns of info rules.

2000-11-26  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* api.xml: Make pdfjadetex work by getting rid of hyperlinks in
	functions titles.
	* Makefile.am (print): Added PDF file dependency.
	($(BASE).pdf): New rule.
	(CLEANFILES): Added pattern *.pdf.gz.

2000-11-26  Alan W, Irwin  <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am ($(HTML_MANIFEST)): Fixed source dependency.

	* api.xml: Improved documentation for plshade and plshade1.
	* advanced.xml: Minor fixes.

2000-11-24  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* plplotdoc-print.dsl.in, plplotdoc-html.dsl.in (element
	funcprototype): Definition changed from element funcsynopsis to
	adapt to DocBook XML 4.1.  This fixes the funny looking boxes in
	the printed version of the manual.

	* Makefile.am (print): Added dvi file as a dependency.
	($(BASE).dvi, $(BASE).jadetex): These rules are not pattern rules
	anymore.  Their targets are not erased after completion.

2000-11-24  Alan W, Irwin  <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

        * advanced.xml, api.xml, simple.xml: Source updates to be
	consistent with docbook 4.1. 

2000-11-19  Rafael Laboissiere  <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>

	* Released overhauled version with Automake support and XML
	translation.
